I am an M.S. student in **Economics & Computation** at **Duke University** (Aug 2024‚ÄìJun 2026).  
My research lies at the intersection of **interpretable machine learning**, **hypergraph learning** for scientific discovery, and **alignment/fairness** in large models.

I am currently working on:
- **ADT + GAM with Monte Carlo Tree Search** ‚Äî an interpretable framework that trains Alternating Decision Trees combined with Generalized Additive Models using efficient tree search.
- **Interpretable Hypergraph Learning** ‚Äî Hypergraph Neural Additive Networks (HGNAN) for **gene-pathway discovery** and **missing-reaction prediction** in genome-scale metabolic networks.
- **Multi-Objective Alignment (MODPO)** ‚Äî aligning language models for **truthfulness** vs. **persuasiveness** in misinformation settings.

### News
- 2025 ‚Äî Working paper **‚ÄúInterpretable Hypergraph Neural Additive Networks‚Äù** posted; under review.  
- 2025 ‚Äî Co-authored **ORLM**, a framework for training large models for **automated optimization modeling** (to appear in *Operations Research*).
