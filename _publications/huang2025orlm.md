This paper presents **ORLM**, a customizable large-model training framework that automates mathematical optimization modeling.  
It integrates symbolic reasoning and neural architectures to generalize across diverse operations research tasks such as linear, integer, and stochastic optimization.  
My contribution focuses on **model interpretability and alignment evaluation** within the multi-objective fine-tuning phase.
