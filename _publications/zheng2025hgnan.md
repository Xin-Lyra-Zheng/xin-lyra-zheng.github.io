We introduce **Hypergraph Neural Additive Networks (HGNAN)**, a new interpretable model that combines **neural additive functions** with **hypergraph structures** to learn high-order gene-pathway interactions.  
This work provides interpretable hyperedge-level explanations, connecting feature-shape visualization with biological interpretability.
